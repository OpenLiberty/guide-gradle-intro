= Building a web application with Gradle

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to build and test a simple web application using Gradle and Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple web servlet application using the Gradle `war` 
plug-in and the Liberty Gradle plug-in. The `war` plug-in compiles and builds the application 
code. The https://github.com/WASdev/ci.gradle/blob/master/README.md[`liberty` Gradle plug-in^] 
installs the Open Liberty runtime, creates a server, and installs the application to run and test.
The application displays a simple web page with a link. When you click that link, the application 
calls the servlet to return a simple response of `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`.

One benefit of using a build tool like Gradle is that after you define the details of the 
project and any dependencies it has, Gradle automatically downloads and installs the dependencies.

Another benefit of using Gradle is that it can run repeatable, automated tests on the application.
You could, of course, test your application manually by starting a server and pointing a web 
browser at the application URL. Automated tests are a much better approach because you can 
easily rerun the same tests each time the application is built. If the tests don't pass after 
you've made a change to the application, the build fails, and you know that you introduced 
a regression that requires a fix to your code.

Using this guide, you will create a Gradle build definition file (`build.gradle`) for the 
web application project, and use it to build the application. You will then create a simple, 
automated test, and configure Gradle to run it after building the application.

Learn more about Gradle on the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html[official Gradle website^].

include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

== Creating the application

The web application that you will build using Gradle and Open Liberty is provided for you 
in the `start` directory so that you can focus on learning about Gradle. The application uses 
the standard Gradle directory structure. Using this directory structure saves you from 
customizing the `build.gradle` file later.

All the application source code, including the Open Liberty server configuration (`server.xml`), 
is in the `start/src` directory:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----

└── src
    └── main
        └── java
        └── liberty
            └── config
        └── webapp
            └── WEB-INF
----

== Testing Gradle

If you do not have Gradle installed, make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set, or that the Java application can run. Running the Gradle Wrapper automatically installs Gradle. To learn more about the Gradle Wrapper, see the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper documentation^].

Test that Gradle is installed properly by running the following command:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
----
gradlew.bat -v
----
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
----
./gradlew -v
----
--

You should see information about the Gradle installation similar to this example:

== Configure your project

The project configuration is defined in the Gradle settings and build files.
You will create these project configurations one section at a time. 

Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[settings^] 
are used to instantiate and configure the project. This sample uses the `settings.gradle` 
to name the project `GradleSample`.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the Gradle settings file.#
`settings.gradle`
---- 

settings.gradle
[source, gradle, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/settings.gradle[]
----

This `settings.gradle` file isn't required for a single-module Gradle project. 
Without this definition, by default, the project name is set as the name of the folder in 
which it is contained (`start` for this example).

Let's go through the `build.gradle` 
file so that you understand each part.

[cols="40, 100"]
|===
| *Configuration* | *Purpose*
| Plug-ins used | The first part of the build file specifies the plug-ins required to 
                  build the project and some basic project configuration.
| buildscript | Where to find plug-ins for download.
| repositories | Where to find dependencies for download.
| dependencies | Java dependencies that are required for compiling, testing, and running 
                 the application are included here. You can also define your Liberty 
                 runtime dependency in this section.
| ext | Gradle extra properties extension for project level properties.
| liberty | Configuration for the Liberty plug-in.
| war | War plug-in configuration.
| test | Unit test and integration test configuration.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the build file.#
`build.gradle`
---- 

build.gradle
[source, gradle, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

The first section of code defines the [hotspot=war file=1]`war` and [hotspot=liberty file=1]`liberty` plug-ins 
that you want to use. The [hotspot=war file=1]`war` plug-in contains all the tasks to compile 
Java files, build the WAR file structure, and assemble the archive. The [hotspot=liberty file=1]`liberty` 
plug-in contains the tasks used to install the Liberty runtime and create and manage 
servers. The [hotspot=group file=1]`group`, [hotspot=version file=1]`version`, and [hotspot=description file=1]`description` 
define this sample project. The compatibility and encoding settings are for Java.

The [hotspot=buildscript file=1]`buildscript` section defines plug-in versions to use in the 
build and where to find them. This guide uses the [hotspot=liberty-dependency file=1]`liberty` plug-in, 
which is available from the Maven Central Repository.

The [hotspot=repositories file=1]`repositories` section defines where to find the dependencies 
that you are using in the build. For this build, everything you need is in Maven Central.

The [hotspot=dependencies file=1]`dependencies` section defines what is needed to compile and 
test the code. This section also defines how to run the application. The 
[hotspot=providecompile file=1]`providedCompile` dependencies are APIs that are needed to compile the 
application, but they do not need to be packaged with the application because Open Liberty 
provides their implementation at run time. For example, the
[hotspot file=2]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java` file 
depends on [hotspot=providecompile file=1]`javax.servlet-api` to compile, but since Open Liberty 
provides that API, it does not need to be packaged with your application. The 
[hotspot=testcompile file=1]`testCompile` dependencies are needed to compile and run tests.

HelloServlet.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java[]
----

The [hotspot=liberty file=1]`liberty` plug-in provides the [hotspot=libertyruntime file=1]`libertyRuntime` 
dependency definition that specifies the version of the Liberty runtime you want to use.
This project uses Open Liberty 17.0.0.4 or later.

The Gradle [hotspot=ext file=1]`extra properties` extension allows you to add properties to a Gradle project.
If you use a value more than once in your build file, you can simplify updates by defining 
it as a variable here and referring to the variable later in the build file.
This project defines variables for the application name, ports, and the context-root.

The [hotspot=liberty2 file=1]`liberty` extension configures the Liberty server, which includes the following settings:
[cols="40, 100"]
|===
| *Server attribute* | *Purpose*
| [hotspot=name file=1]`name` | The server name.
| [hotspot=configfile file=1]`configFile` | The server configuration file.
| [hotspot=bootstrapproperties file=1]`bootstrapProperties` | Bootstrap properties that are written to 
                                                 the server's `bootstrap.properties` file.
| [hotspot=packageliberty file=1]`packageLiberty` | Specifies to only package the `usr` directory 
                                           in the `build/GradleSample.zip` file.
|===

So what's not configured for the [hotspot=liberty2 file=1]`liberty` plug-in?
By default, when the [hotspot=liberty2 file=1]`liberty` and the [hotspot=war2 file=1]`war` 
plug-ins are applied, the default WAR file is installed to the `apps` folder. Omitting 
this definition is the same as including the following line:

[source,groovy]
----
apps = [war]
----

You can also install applications to the `dropins` folder.

Also, by default, a https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_loose_applications.html[loose application^] 
is installed to your Liberty server. Instead of installing a WAR archive, an XML file 
(`GradleSample.war.xml`) is installed that describes the location of the application 
classes, resources, and libraries. This is useful for development because you only need 
to recompile your code, rather than repackaging and redeploy your entire WAR file to see 
application updates live on the server. If you want to turn off loose application support, 
add the following line:

[source,groovy]
----
looseApplication = false
----

The [hotspot=war2 file=1]`war` configuration names the WAR file `GradleSample.war` without a version in the name.

== Testing the web application

One of the benefits of building an application with a build system like Gradle is that 
it can be configured to run a set of automated tests. The [hotspot=war2 file=1]`war` 
plug-in extends the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java plug-in^], 
which provides test tasks. You can write tests for the individual units of code outside 
of a running application server (unit tests), or you can write them to call the application 
that runs on the server (integration tests). In this example, you will create a simple 
integration test that checks that the web page opens and that the correct response is 
returned when the link is clicked.

The Gradle project is configured to start the server with the application installed before 
running the test. After running the test, the server is stopped.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the `EndpointIT` test class.#
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java`
---- 

EndpointIT.java 
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[]
----

The test class name ends in `it` to indicate that it contains an integration test.
The integration tests are put in the `it` folder by convention.

build.gradle   
[source, groovy, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

The [hotspot=tests file=1]`test` section in your build file configures Gradle to run the integration tests in the `it` folder.

The [hotspot=sysproperties file=1]`systemProperties` configuration defines some variables needed by 
the test class. While the port number and context-root information can be hardcoded in 
the test class, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Gradle 
[hotspot file=1]`build.gradle` file, in case they need to change.
The [hotspot=sysproperties file=1]`systemProperties` section passes these details to the Java test 
program as a series of system properties, resolving the [hotspot=sysproperties file=1]`liberty.test.port` 
and [hotspot=sysproperties file=1]`war.name` variables.

The [hotspot=init file=0]`init()` method in the `EndpointIT.java` test class uses these 
system variables to build the URL of the application.

In the test class, after defining how to build the application URL, the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` 
annotation indicates the start of the test method.

In the [hotspot=try file=0]`try` block of the test method, an HTTP `GET` request to the 
URL of the application returns a status code. If the response to the request includes the 
string `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`, the test passes. If that string is not in the 
response, the test fails. The HTTP client then disconnects from the application.

In the [hotspot=import file=0]`import` statements of this test class, you'll notice that the 
test has some new dependencies. Earlier you added some [hotspot=testcompile file=1]`testCompile` 
dependencies. The Apache [hotspot=commons file=1]`commons-httpclient` and [hotspot=junit file=1]`junit` 
dependencies are needed to compile and run the integration test [hotspot=endpointit file=0]`EndpointIT` 
class.

The scope for each of the dependencies is set to [hotspot=testcompile file=1]`testCompile` 
because the libraries are needed only during the Gradle test phase and do not need to be 
packaged with the application.

Now, during the build, Gradle installs the application and then runs any integration test 
classes in the `it` folder.

The directory structure of the project in the `start` folder should now look like this 
example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
└── build.gradle
├── settings.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    │    ├── java
    │    ├── liberty
    │    │    └── config
    │    └── webapp
    │         └── WEB_INF
    └── test
         └── java

----

== A few more pieces
We show a few more Gradle tricks in this example with the [hotspot=openbrowser]`openBrowser` and 
the [hotspot=opentestreport]`openTestReport` tasks. These tasks display your application and the 
test report in the default browser.


build.gradle 
[source, groovy, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

The final Gradle magic to add is the task dependency directives.
The [hotspot=depends]`dependency directives` associate the `war` and `java` tasks to the `liberty` tasks to get proper 
task ordering.


== Ready to run

You can now run the build command to build and test the application.

From the folder containing your [hotspot file=0]`build.gradle` file, run the command:

build.gradle   
[source, groovy, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
----
gradlew.bat build -i
----
--


[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
----
./gradlew build -i
----
--

The `-i` option provides additional information on the command line. The build takes a 
little longer than before the test existed, but expect to see the browser opened with the 
test summary displayed.

To see whether the test detects a failure, change the response string in the 
[hotspot file=1]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java` file 
so that it doesn't match the string that the test is looking for. Then rerun the Gradle 
integration tests by running the command:

HelloServlet.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java[]
----

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
----
gradlew.bat integrationTest -i
----
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
----
./gradlew integrationTest -i
----
--

Then, check to see if the test fails.

== Great work! You're done!

You built and tested a web application project with an Open Liberty server using Gradle.
