NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to build and test a simple web application using Gradle and Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple web servlet application using the Gradle `war` 
plug-in and the Liberty Gradle plug-in. The `war` plug-in compiles and builds the application 
code. The https://github.com/WASdev/ci.gradle/blob/master/README.md[`liberty` Gradle plug-in^] 
installs the Open Liberty runtime, creates a server, and installs the application to run and test.
The application displays a simple web page with a link. When you click that link, the application 
calls the servlet to return a simple response of `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`.

One benefit of using a build tool like Gradle is that you can define the details of the project and any dependencies it has, and Gradle automatically downloads and installs the dependencies.
Another benefit of using Gradle is that it can run repeatable, automated tests on the application. 
You can, of course, test your application manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the application URL. 
However, automated tests are a much better approach because you can easily rerun the same tests each time the application is built.
If the tests don't pass after you change the application, the build fails, and you know that you introduced a regression that requires a fix to your code.

Choosing a build tool often comes down to personal or organizational preference, but you might choose to use Gradle for several reasons. 
Gradle defines its builds by using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/writing_build_scripts.html[Groovy build scripts^], which gives you a lot of control and customization in your builds. 
Gradle also uses a build cache that rebuilds only the parts of your application that changed, which saves build time in larger projects.
So Gradle can be a good choice in larger, more complex projects.

Using this guide, you will create a Gradle build definition file (`build.gradle`) for the 
web application project, and use it to build the application. You will then create a simple, 
automated test, and configure Gradle to run it after building the application.

Learn more about Gradle on the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html[official Gradle website^].

== Creating the application

The web application that you will build using Gradle and Open Liberty is provided for you 
in the `start` directory so that you can focus on learning about Gradle. The application uses 
the standard Gradle directory structure. Using this directory structure saves you from 
customizing the `build.gradle` file later.

All the application source code, including the Open Liberty server configuration (`server.xml`), 
is in the `start/src` directory:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----

└── src
    └── main
        └── java
        └── liberty
            └── config
        └── webapp
            └── WEB-INF
----

== Testing Gradle

If you do not have Gradle installed, make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set, or that the Java application can run. Running the Gradle Wrapper automatically installs Gradle. To learn more about the Gradle Wrapper, see the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper documentation^].

Run the following commands to navigate to the `start` directory and verify that Gradle was installed correctly:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[role='command']
----
cd start
gradlew.bat -v
----
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]

[role='command']
----
cd start
./gradlew -v

The project configuration is defined in the Gradle settings and build files.
You will create these project configurations one section at a time. 

Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[settings^] 
are used to instantiate and configure the project. This sample uses the [hotspot file=0]`settings.gradle` 
to name the project `GradleSample`.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the Gradle settings file.#
`settings.gradle`
---- 

This [hotspot file=0]`settings.gradle` file isn't required for a single-module Gradle project. 
Without this definition, by default, the project name is set as the name of the folder in 
which it is contained (`start` for this example).

Let's go through the [hotspot file=1]`build.gradle` 
file so that you understand each part.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the build file.#
`build.gradle`
---- 

The first section of code defines the [hotspot=war file=1]`war` and [hotspot=liberty file=1]`liberty` plug-ins 
that you want to use. The [hotspot=war file=1]`war` plug-in contains all the tasks to compile 
Java files, build the WAR file structure, and assemble the archive. The [hotspot=liberty file=1]`liberty` 
plug-in contains the tasks used to install the Liberty runtime and create and manage 
servers. The compatibility and encoding settings are for Java.

The [hotspot=buildscript file=1]`buildscript` section defines plug-in versions to use in the 
build and where to find them. This guide uses the [hotspot=liberty-dependency file=1]`liberty` plug-in, 
which is available from the [hotspot=buildmaven file=1]`Maven Central Repository`.

The [hotspot=repositories file=1]`repositories` section defines where to find the dependencies 
that you are using in the build. For this build, everything you need is in [hotspot=maven file=1]`Maven Central`.

The [hotspot=dependencies file=1]`dependencies` section defines what is needed to compile and 
test the code. This section also defines how to run the application. The 
[hotspot=providedcompile file=1]`providedCompile` dependencies are APIs that are needed to compile the 
application, but they do not need to be packaged with the application because Open Liberty 
provides their implementation at run time. The [hotspot=testimplementation file=1]`testImplementation` dependencies 
are needed to compile and run tests.

The Gradle [hotspot=ext file=1]`extra properties` extension allows you to add properties to a Gradle project.
If you use a value more than once in your build file, you can simplify updates by defining 
it as a variable here and referring to the variable later in the build file.
This project defines variables for the application ports and the context-root.

== Running the application

Start Open Liberty in development mode, which starts the Open Liberty server and listens for file changes:

[role='command']
----
./gradlew libertyDev
----

After you see the following message, your application server in development mode is ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
Press the Enter key to run tests on demand.
----

The development mode holds your command prompt to listen for file changes.
You need to open another command prompt to continue, or simply open the project in your editor.

Navigate your browser to the http://localhost:9080/GradleSample/servlet[^] URL to access the application. 
The servlet returns a simple response of `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`.

== Testing the web application

//file 0
EndpointIT.java 
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[]
----

//file 1
build.gradle   
[source, groovy, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

//file 2
HelloServlet.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java[]
----

One of the benefits of building an application with a build system like Gradle is that 
it can be configured to run a set of automated tests. The [hotspot=war file=1]`war` 
plug-in extends the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java plug-in^], 
which provides test tasks. You can write tests for the individual units of code outside 
of a running application server (unit tests), or you can write them to call the application 
that runs on the server (integration tests). In this example, you will create a simple 
integration test that checks that the web page opens and that the correct response is 
returned when the link is clicked.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Create the `EndpointIT` test class.#
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java`
---- 

The test class name ends in `IT` to indicate that it contains an integration test.
The integration tests are put in the `it` folder by convention.

The [hotspot=tests file=1]`test` section in your build file is added by the Java plug-in, and the 
[hotspot=junitplatform file=1]`useJUnitPlatform()` line configures Gradle to add JUnit 5 support.

The [hotspot=systemproperty file=1]`systemProperty` configuration  defines some variables needed by 
the test class. While the port number and context-root information can be 
hardcoded in the test class, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Gradle 
[hotspot file=1]`build.gradle` file, in case they need to change.
The [hotspot=systemproperty file=1]`systemProperty` lines passes these details to the test JVMs 
as a series of system properties, resolving the [hotspot=httpport file=1]`http.port` 
and [hotspot=contextroot file=1]`context.root` variables.

The [hotspot=init file=0]`init()` method in the `EndpointIT.java` test class uses these 
system variables to build the URL of the application.

In the test class, after defining how to build the application URL, the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` 
annotation indicates the start of the test method.

In the [hotspot=try file=0]`try` block of the test method, an HTTP `GET` request to the 
URL of the application returns a status code. If the response to the request includes the 
string `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`, the test passes. If that string is not in the 
response, the test fails. The HTTP client then disconnects from the application.

In the [hotspot=import file=0]`import` statements of this test class, you'll notice that the 
test has some new dependencies. Earlier you added some [hotspot=testimplementation file=1]`testImplementation` 
dependencies. The Apache [hotspot=commons file=1]`commons-httpclient` and [hotspot=junit file=1]`org.junit.jupiter` 
dependencies are needed to compile and run the integration test [hotspot=endpointit file=0]`EndpointIT` 
class.

The scope for each of the dependencies is set to [hotspot=testimplementation file=1]`testImplementation` 
because the libraries are needed only during the Gradle test phase and do not need to be 
packaged with the application.

Now, the created WAR file contains the web application, and development mode can run any integration 
test classes that it finds. Integration test classes are classes with names that end in `IT`.

The directory structure of the project in the `start` folder should now look like this 
example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
└── build.gradle
├── settings.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    │    ├── java
    │    ├── liberty
    │    │    └── config
    │    └── webapp
    │         └── WEB_INF
    └── test
         └── java

----

=== A few more pieces

We show a few more Gradle tricks in this example with the [hotspot=openbrowser file=1]`openBrowser` task. 
This task displays your application and the test report in the default browser.

The final Gradle magic to add is the task dependency directives.
The [hotspot=depends file=1]`dependency directives` organizes task execution. 
In this case, the test task is set to run after the server is started, and the
[hotspot=openbrowser file=1]`openBrowser` task is executed after the test task is finalized.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press the `enter/return` 
key to run the tests. You will see that the browser opened up the test summary page, which ran one successful test.

To see whether the test detects a failure, change the [hotspot=responsestring file=2]`response string` in the 
[hotspot file=2]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java` file 
so that it doesn't match the string that the test is looking for. Then rerun the Gradle 
test to automatically restart and retest your application to check to see if the test fails.
